## Features

- **Automatic Environment Creation**: Creates Elastic Beanstalk applications and environments if they don't exist
- **Deployment Package Management**: Auto-creates deployment packages from your repository or uses pre-built packages
- **S3 Upload**: Uploads deployment artifacts to S3 for version management
- **Health Monitoring**: Waits for deployment completion and environment health recovery
- **Event Streaming**: Displays real-time deployment events in GitHub Actions logs
- **Intelligent Retries**: Exponential backoff for transient API failures
- **Version Reuse**: Optionally skip S3 upload if version already exists

## Prerequisites

Before using this action, you need to set up AWS IAM permissions. This section walks you through the required steps.

### Step 1: Configure AWS Authentication

This action supports two authentication methods. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

#### Option A: OpenID Connect (OIDC) — Recommended

OIDC lets GitHub Actions authenticate with AWS using short-lived credentials without storing long-lived secrets. This is the recommended approach.

**1. Create an OIDC Identity Provider** (one-time per AWS account)

In the AWS Console: IAM → Identity providers → Add provider
- **Provider type**: OpenID Connect
- **Provider URL**: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` (click "Get thumbprint")
- **Audience**: `sts.amazonaws.com`

**2. Create an IAM Role**

Create an IAM role that GitHub Actions will assume. Attach the permissions from [Step 2](#step-2-attach-required-permissions), and set the following trust policy (replace `{account-id}` and `{your-org/your-repo}`):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "StringLike": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:{your-org/your-repo}:*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

> **Note:** The `sub` condition is case-sensitive and must match your GitHub `owner/repo` exactly.

#### Option B: Static Credentials

Create an IAM user with an access key and attach the permissions from [Step 2](#step-2-attach-required-permissions).

> **Note:** Static credentials are long-lived and must be rotated manually. OIDC is preferred for security.

### Step 2: Attach Required Permissions

Whether you're using an IAM role (OIDC) or IAM user (static credentials), attach the following two policies:

**1. Elastic Beanstalk Permissions**

Attach the AWS managed policy **`AdministratorAccess-AWSElasticBeanstalk`**. This policy grants the permissions that Elastic Beanstalk requires from the calling principal to create and manage environments, including interactions with EC2, Auto Scaling, CloudFormation, and other services that Elastic Beanstalk orchestrates during deployment.

**2. S3 Bucket Permissions**

This action uploads your deployment package to S3 before creating an application version. This is required because the Elastic Beanstalk `CreateApplicationVersion` API requires the source bundle to be stored in S3—you cannot pass the deployment package directly to the API.

The S3 bucket name defaults to `{applicationName}-{accountId}` (e.g., `my-app-123456789012`), or you can specify a custom bucket name using the `s3-bucket-name` input.

Add the following inline policy (replace `{bucket-name}` with your bucket name):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::{bucket-name}",
                "arn:aws:s3:::{bucket-name}/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 3: Create IAM Roles for Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk requires two IAM roles that must be passed in the `option-settings` input:

**1. Instance Profile** (`aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`)

This role is assumed by EC2 instances in your environment. It allows instances to:
- Upload logs to S3 and CloudWatch
- Download application versions from S3
- Send metrics to CloudWatch

See: [Managing Elastic Beanstalk Instance Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-instanceprofile.html)

**2. Service Role** (`aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`)

This role is assumed by Elastic Beanstalk itself. It allows the service to:
- Create and manage AWS resources (EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, etc.)
- Monitor environment health
- Perform managed platform updates

See: [Managing Elastic Beanstalk Service Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-servicerole.html)

**Creating the Roles**

- [Create the Instance Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-instanceprofile.html#iam-instanceprofile-create)
- [Create the Service Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/iam-servicerole.html#iam-servicerole-create)

### Step 4: Add GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

**If using OIDC:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` | ARN of the IAM role (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-github-actions-role`) |

**If using static credentials:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Access key ID for your IAM user |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret access key for your IAM user |

```

See the [complete list of configuration options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html) in AWS documentation.

## API Usage

This action makes AWS API calls during deployment. Understanding the API usage helps you estimate costs and troubleshoot rate limiting issues.

### API Calls Per Deployment

| API | Calls | When |
|-----|-------|------|
| **STS** | | |
| `GetCallerIdentity` | 1 | Always (verify credentials) |
| **S3** | | |
| `HeadBucket` | 1 | Check if bucket exists |
| `CreateBucket` | 0-1 | Only if bucket doesn't exist and `create-s3-bucket-if-not-exists: true` |
| `GetBucketAcl` | 1 | Verify bucket access |
| `PutObject` | 0-1 | Upload deployment package (skipped if version exists and `use-existing-application-version-if-available: true`) |
| **Elastic Beanstalk** | | |
| `DescribeApplicationVersions` | 1-2 | Check if version exists, get S3 location |
| `CreateApplicationVersion` | 0-1 | Only if version doesn't exist |
| `DescribeEnvironments` | 1 + N | Initial check + polling during deployment |
| `CreateEnvironment` | 0-1 | Only if environment doesn't exist |
| `UpdateEnvironment` | 0-1 | Only if environment exists |
| `DescribeEvents` | N | Polling during deployment (every 10-20 seconds) |

### Polling Behavior

- **Environment creation**: Polls every 20 seconds
- **Environment update**: Polls every 10 seconds
- **Health recovery**: Polls every 15 seconds
- **Events**: Fetched with each environment status poll

### Estimated Total API Calls

| Scenario | Estimated Calls |
|----------|-----------------|
| Update existing environment (5 min deployment) | ~40-50 calls |
| Create new environment (10 min deployment) | ~60-80 calls |
| Reuse existing version (skip S3 upload) | ~35-45 calls |

### Cost Considerations

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk API calls are free
- S3 requests have minimal costs (fractions of a cent per deployment)
- The primary costs come from the AWS resources created (EC2, ELB, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Finding Solution Stack Names

List available solution stacks for your region:

```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --region us-east-1

# Filter by platform
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --region us-east-1 | grep -i python
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --region us-east-1 | grep -i node
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --region us-east-1 | grep -i corretto
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --region us-east-1 | grep -i docker
```

### Common Errors

**"option-settings must include IamInstanceProfile"**

When creating a new environment, you must provide IAM roles in `option-settings`. See [Option Settings](#option-settings).

**"Environment name must be 4-40 characters"**

Environment names must be 4-40 characters, contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and cannot start or end with a hyphen.

**S3 Access Denied**

Ensure your IAM user or role has S3 permissions for the deployment bucket. See [Step 2: Attach Required Permissions](#step-2-attach-required-permissions).

**Deployment Timeout**

Increase the timeout for slow deployments:

```yaml
deployment-timeout: 1800  # 30 minutes
```

**Red Health Status**

If the environment health is Red after deployment:
1. Check CloudWatch Logs for application errors
2. Verify your application listens on the correct port (5000 for most platforms)
3. Ensure health check endpoint responds correctly

### Skipping Health Wait

For faster deployments in non-production environments:

```yaml
wait-for-environment-recovery: false
```
